    <div class="question">A woman leased a condo from the owner for a period of one year. After six months, the owner gave the woman a written option to purchase the condo for $100,000 before the expiration of the lease. With the owner's approval, the woman spent $10,000 to have the kitchen remodeled to her personal specifications. One month before the end of the lease, the owner notified the woman that he was revoking the option to purchase the condo. One week later, the woman delivered a written notice of acceptance of the option, but the owner refused to sell. If the woman initiates suit for breach of contract, which of the following is her strongest argument that an enforceable contract was formed between her and the owner?</div>
    <div class="choices">
        <label class="choice-A"><input type="radio" name="answer" value="A"><span>Because the woman had until the expiration of the lease to accept the offer, the owner's revocation would be ineffective.</span></label>
        <label class="choice-B"><input type="radio" name="answer" value="B"><span>Because the owner was a merchant, the written offer was irrevocable for a period not exceeding three months.</span></label>
        <label class="choice-C"><input type="radio" name="answer" value="C"><span>Because the owner's offer invited a return promise as acceptance, the woman manifested her intent to accept by remodeling the kitchen.</span></label>
        <label class="choice-D"><input type="radio" name="answer" value="D"><span>After the woman paid to have the kitchen remodeled, an option contract resulted, because the owner knew the woman was relying on the offer to her detriment.</span></label>
