    <div class="question">A state law imposes penalties for "any public statement containing false or misleading information about a service or product." An airline falsely claimed in an advertisement that its competitor had an inferior safety record. The claim was based on erroneous information, found on the website of a nonprofit consumer advocacy group, that the airline assumed to be true. The airline was charged under the state law for making a false statement. No federal statute applies. Which of the following best supports the airline in a defense based on the First Amendment?</div>

        <label class="choice"><input type="radio" name="answer" value="C" ><span>The state law is overbroad.</span></label>
